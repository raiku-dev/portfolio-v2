# Life is a video game

You’re not lazy, you’re just bored fast and need direct feedback.

Imagine walking around with an XP-Bar on your arm.
Your level, current experience and the experience needed for your level up always visible for you to see and analyse.

All of the sudden the effects of every page you read, of every rep you do at the gym and every effort to better yourself have a direct way of giving you feedback.

How would this change your daily behaviour?

This is where visualisation comes in.

Visualise this bar, see it fill up with every good activity and imagine a new level reached with every accomplishment.

Gamify your life, lose all instant gratification temptations and watch how much fun life and work can be.
