These notes may be a bit unstructured and wild at times - maybe even trivial.
They are not meant to be a summary but rather a list of personal takeaways from each chapter.

## Foreword
- *"It doesn't matter what the programs are about or what applications they serve. What does matter is how well they perform and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of still greater programs."*
- Programs must be correct in every detail
- Large programs grow from small ones - we should utilize proven idioms and combine these to form larger programs.
- We can find modularity everywhere - smaller pieces and techniques forming the bigger product.
- Strive for performance
- *"Invent  and fit; have fits and reinvent!"* - Describing the nature the functional Lisp code that is filled with discretionary functions. (discretionary in German: 'nach eigenem Ermessen', describing the functions being implemented by an individual programmer based on his judgement)
