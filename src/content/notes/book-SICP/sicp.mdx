These notes may be a bit unstructured and wild at times - maybe even trivial.
They are not meant to be a summary but rather a list of personal takeaways from each chapter.

## Foreword
- *"It doesn't matter what the programs are about or what applications they serve. What does matter is how well they perform and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of still greater programs."*
- Programs must be correct in every detail
- Large programs grow from small ones - we should utilize proven idioms and combine these to form larger programs.
- We can find modularity everywhere - smaller pieces and techniques forming the bigger product.
- Strive for performance
- *"Invent  and fit; have fits and reinvent!"* - Describing the nature the functional Lisp code that is filled with discretionary functions. (discretionary in German: 'nach eigenem Ermessen', describing the functions being implemented by an individual programmer based on his judgement)

## Preface
- Programs are ever changing. Like this book. This is the second edition and it had to change to accommodate for the new ways and requirements of modern software engineering. It grew.
- *"...a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."*
- After this book I should be ready to read a 50 page long program and know what not to read and what I don't need to understand at any given moment while feeling secure about modifying the program and retaining the style of the original author.
