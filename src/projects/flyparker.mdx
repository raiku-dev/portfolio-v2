title: 'FlyParker - Airport Parking Platform'
description: 'When a friend of mine had an idea to launch an airport-parking comparison / booking service, I was more than glad to help him out and build and host the platform for him. In this project I was able to bring in all my experience in full-stack development, linux administration and hosting.'
